Returns an integer representing the number of members that were actually added to the set (not counting members already present). Returns an error if the key exists but is not a set type. The operation updates memory tracking and is recorded to AOF if persistence is enabled. This operation is atomic and thread-safe.",

Returns 0 if the key does not exist (treating a non-existent key as an empty set). Returns an error if the key exists but is not a set type. This operation is O(1) as the cardinality is tracked internally. This operation is thread-safe and uses a read lock.",
